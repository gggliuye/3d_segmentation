## [Loop closure](https://github.com/gggliuye/3d_vision/blob/master/rgbd_camera_track/Loop_closure_BOW.ipynb)
For the illustration of Loop closure method using bag of words (functions offered by OPENCV)

## bundle adjustment
For test some basic bundle ajustment algorithms for further development
- with optimization of camera poses
- and the optimization of positions of feature points

## camera track rgbd
Basic test of functions (which will be used for build a class object). 
- Using feature detections and matching methods.
- frame-to-frame SLAM algorithm
- futher integrate with the upper bundle adjustment and loop closing algorithms.
